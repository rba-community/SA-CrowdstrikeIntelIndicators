Issue | Description | Solution
----- | ----------- | --------
Multiple asset merge | It is possible that some of your devices share a common key field (`dns`, `ip`, `mac`, `nt_host`) which will cause merging by default. |See the [Asset Merge Solutions](asset-merge.md) for ways to improve the merging behavior.
Asset Database not populating with #TODO Data | The asset database may show no #TODO data if the initial search has not run to build the asset database or the default macro has not been updated. | Verify the default macro has the correct index definition (see [Update Default Macro](../start/macro.md)). Also see [Force build](../start/build.md) to build the #TODO assets lookup before the first scheduled run.
